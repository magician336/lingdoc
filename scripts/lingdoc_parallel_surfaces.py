"""The parallel work face manifest: the single place that says *who may touch what*.

What this file is
-----------------
LingDoc's G1-G7 development line is not one queue.  It is a set of **parallel
work faces** -- groups of paths that one executor may own end to end, so that
two executors can work at the same time without editing the same file.

This manifest is the one declaration of that ownership.  For every face it
records

* the face name (unique),
* the **tracker issue** that carries the face (the ticket an executor claims),
* the G1-G7 Spec issues the face delivers,
* the **path set** the face owns, and the kind of each path (``file`` for an
  exact path, ``dir`` for a directory prefix),
* the scheduling status (``available`` / ``claimed`` / ``blocked`` / ``done``),
* who claimed it, if anybody,
* the implementation dependencies the face resolves, if any.

The manifest is **declarative data**.  It answers ownership questions only:
which paths belong to which face.  It contains no decision logic, and it does
not decide whether a face may start -- the *status* field records that, and a
human keeps it current.

Why the path sets must not overlap
-----------------------------------
Two faces that own the same file cannot be worked on in parallel: the second
one to land silently overwrites or conflicts with the first.  The loader
rejects any manifest where two faces' path sets overlap, or where a face
claims a reserved path.  A broken record aborts with a non-zero exit status
-- it never degrades silently.

Terms
-----
``face``
    One parallel unit of work: a name, a path set, and the Spec issues it
    delivers.

``reserved path``
    A path that no face may own, because it is an integration point where
    several faces land at once.  It is integrated in a separate, explicit
    step.

``status``
    ``available`` -- nobody has claimed the face, it can be taken.
    ``claimed`` -- somebody is working on it.
    ``blocked`` -- the face cannot start; it is waiting on an implementation
    dependency it does not own.
    ``done`` -- the face has landed; its paths are part of ``main``.

How to add a face
-----------------
1. Open a tracker issue for the face and note its number -- the face's ticket
   is what an executor claims, and it carries the face's acceptance criteria.
2. Append a record to ``PARALLEL_FACES`` with the fields listed above,
   including that issue number.
3. Run ``python scripts/lingdoc_parallel_surfaces.py``.  The loader
   validates the record: the face name must be unique, the status must be
   legal, the path set must not be empty, the issues must be known G1-G7
   issues, and no two faces may own the same path.  A broken record aborts
   with a non-zero exit status.
4. Only then hand the face to an executor.

The path diagram (``docs/08-本轮实施方案/G1-G7-Spec-完成路径图.md``) explains
*what* the faces are and *why* the dependency graph does not serialise the
work.  This file is where the ownership is kept current.

Where this file lives
---------------------
It sits in ``scripts/`` and not in ``scripts/ci/``: that directory belongs to
the gate judgement layer, whose whole point is that exactly one module answers
"what runs".  This manifest answers a different question -- "who may touch
which path" -- and a second manifest in the judgement layer would blur that
boundary.  Its guard test lives in ``scripts/ci/`` because that is where the
CI runs the guard tests from.
